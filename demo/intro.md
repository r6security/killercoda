### Welcome !

In this demo, we'll demonstrate how effectively the AMTD operator can protect your applications running in Kubernetes by going through two scenarios.

The demo consists the following steps:

# Setting up the infrastructure

1. Deploy the AMTD operator

2. Deploy the Time-based Trigger

# Going through the security scenarios:

1. Scheduled restart with Time-based Trigger

2. KubeArmor based on-demand application restart
