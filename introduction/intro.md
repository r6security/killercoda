### Welcome !

In this demo, we'll demonstrate how effectively the AMTD operator can protect your applications running in Kubernetes by going through three scenarios.

The demo consists the following steps:

# Setting up the infrastructure

1. Deploy the Time-based Trigger

2. Deploy the Falco-integrator

3. Deploy the AMTD operator

# Going through the security scenarios:

1. Scheduled restart with Time-based Trigger

2. On-demand restart with Falco-integrator

3. On-Demand quarantine with Falco-integrator

**HAVE FUN**
